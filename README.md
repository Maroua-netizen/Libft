# Libft

Libft is a custom implementation of standard C library functions along with additional utility functions. This project is part of the 42 curriculum and serves as a foundational exercise in understanding and implementing core C functionalities.

Each function has a comment including a test template to see if the function works correctly. Feel free to use those templates for your own functions.

The mandatory functions passed all the tests, peer evaluations and moulinette, and the project passed with a grade of 100%.
